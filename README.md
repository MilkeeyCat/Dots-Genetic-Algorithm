#Dots trying to reach the goal using Genetic Algorithm

If you want to run it by yourself just copy repo and run `npx http-server` command

I used here A* path finding algorithm to calculate which dot is the best but sometimes it can show a very weird path :p\
\
Anyway I'm happy with the result because at least it works.
